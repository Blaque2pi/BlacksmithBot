I apologize for that oversight. Here's the reformatted chunk of the README in a markdown block:

# Dungeon Master's NPC Bot for Discord

## Overview
Dungeon Master's NPC (Non-Player Character) Bot is a Discord bot built to assist Dungeon Masters by dynamically creating and simulating NPCs in the game of Dungeons and Dragons.

## Features

- **Dynamic NPC Generation**: Automatically generate unique NPCs with characteristics like name, age, personality, occupation, knowledge, and secrets.
  
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverage the power of the GPT-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI to simulate real-time NPC dialogues and responses.
  
- **In-Bot Commands**: Execute special commands directly in the chat interface to interact with the bot, e.g., resetting the NPC or inspecting the bot's internal state.
  
- **Ability Checks**: Perform dice rolls and ability checks directly within the chat for immersive gameplay.

## Dependencies

The bot requires the following Python libraries:

- `openai`: To use the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- `discord`: To enable Discord bot functionalities.
- `asyncio`: For asynchronous operations.
- `json`: To handle JSON formatted data.
- `decouple`: For managing configurations and environment variables.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install openai discord asyncio python-decouple
    ```

2. **Configuration**: 
    - Set up the necessary environment variables:
        - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
        - Each NPC profile should have a unique Discord token. It should be named following the pattern `NPCNAME_NPCSURNAME_DISCORD_TOKEN`.
        - Similarly, set up a Discord channel ID for each NPC using the format `NPCNAME_NPCSURNAME_CHANNEL_ID`.
        - `BLAKE`: This is presumably an identifier for the bot master or an admin (for elevated bot controls).

3. **Run the Bot**:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

    Upon running, you'll be prompted to input a location. This sets the backdrop or environment for the NPCs.

## How to Use

- **Engaging with NPCs**: Start a conversation by sending messages in the NPC's dedicated Discord channel.

- **Ability Checks**: Use the format `[persuasion] Your message here` if you wish to try and persuade the NPC during a conversation.

- **Admin Commands**:
    - `reset`: This command will reset the NPC to its original state.
    - `print`: Admin-only command. It prints the conversation history.
    - `sleep`: Another admin-exclusive command. It's used to shut down the bot.
